# Neural-Networks from Scratch - An Exercise

This project is an exercise to build various neural-networks from scratch. 
Of course, professional libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow are far better optimized,
however the idea of this project is not optimization but rather the understanding of the inner workings.
As toady's models have become so big that it seems notoriously difficult to understand their decision making exactly, 
I think that it is a good idea to return to the fundamentals, especially when learning the field.

My former supervisor and friend often claims that the only theorem they truely understand is that 1 < 2.

This project is in their spirit: Firstly, small exercises aimed at understanding neural networks of the simplest possible architecture. 
Afterwards, we can focus on 2.
